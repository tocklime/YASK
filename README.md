Here are the assembly instructions for V1: https://youtu.be/82yD0RMeEw8

We now have 2 versions to choose from:
* V1: is ortholinear, and uses Cherry-type key switches
* V2.1: has vertical stargger, is angled (10Â° each hand), requires Kailh Choc key switches (either with or without hot-swap sockets), and features a plate (optional). Moreover the left pinky and the left/right # and * are wired separately, allowing for more flexibility.
